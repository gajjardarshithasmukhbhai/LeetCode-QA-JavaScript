## Explanation

This solution finds, for each index in the array, the length of the smallest subarray starting at that index whose bitwise OR is the maximum possible for any subarray starting at that index.

### Step-by-step Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `setBitIndex`: An array of size 32 (for 32 bits), initialized to -1. It keeps track of the latest index where each bit is set in the array.
   - `result`: Stores the answer for each index.

2. **Iterate from right to left**:
   - For each index `i` (from `n-1` to `0`), we want to find the farthest index to the right we need to go to get all the bits that could contribute to the maximum OR.

3. **Bitwise Check**:
   - For each bit position `j` (from 0 to 31), check if the `j`-th bit is set in `nums[i]` using `(nums[i] & (1 << j))`.
   - If the bit is set, update `setBitIndex[j]` to `i`.
   - If not set and `setBitIndex[j]` is not -1, update `endIndex` to the farthest index where this bit was last seen.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The length of the smallest subarray is `endIndex - i + 1`.

### Example

Suppose `nums = [1, 0, 2, 1, 3]`.

- For `i = 4` (`nums[4]=3`): bits set are 0 and 1. So, only need subarray of length 1.
- For `i = 3` (`nums[3]=1`): bit 0 is set, but to get bit 1 (from index 4), need subarray `[1, 3]` (length 2).
- For `i = 2` (`nums[2]=2`): bit 1 is set, but to get bit 0 (from index 3 or 4), need subarray `[2, 1, 3]` (length 3).
- And so on.

### How `(nums[i] & (1 << j))` Works

- `1 << j` shifts the number 1 left by `j` positions, creating a mask with only the `j`-th bit set.
- `nums[i] & (1 << j)` checks if the `j`-th bit in `nums[i]` is set.
  - If the result is not zero, the bit is set.
  - If the result is zero, the bit is not set.

**Example:**
- If `nums[i] = 5` (binary `101`), and `j = 0`, `1 << 0 = 1` (binary `001`), `5 & 1 = 1` (bit 0 is set).
- If `j = 1`, `1 << 1 = 2` (binary `010`), `5 & 2 = 0` (bit 1 is not set).
- If `j = 2`, `1 << 2 = 4` (binary `100`), `5 & 4 = 4` (bit 2 is set).

This operation helps the algorithm efficiently check which bits are present in each number and track their latest positions.
