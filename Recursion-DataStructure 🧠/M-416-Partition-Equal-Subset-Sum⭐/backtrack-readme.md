# Detailed Approach: "Take or Not Take" in Backtracking

The goal is to determine if the given array can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sums. This is achieved using a backtracking approach that explores all possible subsets by either including or excluding each element of the array.

---

## Steps in the Approach:

### Step 1: **Calculate the Target Sum**

- First, calculate the total sum of the array (`totalValue`).
- If `totalValue` is not divisible by 2, it's impossible to partition the array into two equal subsets, and we return `false`.
- Otherwise, set the target sum for each subset as `target = totalValue / 2`.

### Step 2: **Recursive Function (Helper)**

- Define a helper function `helper(index, current, sum)` that:
  - Tracks the current index in the array (`index`).
  - Maintains the current subset being explored (`current`).
  - Accumulates the current sum of elements in the subset (`sum`).

#### Base Cases:

1. **Subset Found**:
   - If the `sum` equals `target`, return `true` (indicating a valid partition has been found).
2. **Invalid Path**:
   - If `sum` exceeds `target` or `index` exceeds the length of the array, return `false`.

### Step 3: **"Take or Not Take" Decision**

At each step, make two recursive calls to explore the decision tree:

1. **Take the Current Element**:

   - Include `arr[index]` in the current subset:
     - Add `arr[index]` to `current`.
     - Increment the `sum` by `arr[index]`.
   - Recursively call `helper(index + 1, current, sum)` to explore further subsets.

2. **Not Take the Current Element**:
   - Remove `arr[index]` from the current subset:
     - Pop the last element from `current`.
     - Subtract `arr[index]` from `sum`.
   - Recursively call `helper(index + 1, current, sum)` to explore subsets without including the current element.

---

### Step 4: **Final Decision**

- If either of the two recursive calls (`"take"` or `"not take"`) returns `true`, the function immediately returns `true`.
- Otherwise, if both paths fail, return `false`.

### Code Walkthrough for Input `[1, 2, 3, 5]`

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Total Sum = `11` → Target = `5.5` (Not an integer)
   - The function immediately returns `false` because a subset sum can't be fractional.

---

### Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity**:

   - In the worst case, the recursion explores all subsets of the array. For an array of size `n`, there are `2^n` subsets.
   - Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^n)`.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The recursion stack can go up to a depth of `n`.
   - Therefore, the space complexity is `O(n)`.

### Example

#### Input: `[1, 5, 11, 5]`

- Total Sum = `22` → Target = `11`
- Recursive exploration finds that `[11]` and `[1, 5, 5]` form two subsets with equal sums.

#### Input: `[1, 2, 3, 5]`

- Total Sum = `11` → Target = `5.5`
- Function immediately returns `false` as partitioning isn't possible.
