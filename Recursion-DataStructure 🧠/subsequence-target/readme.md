**Here I mentioned the All New Pattern here for Recursion**

- count the subsequence Array
- get subsequence based on the target
- get first subsequence from the ARRAY

- keyNote: when the **count =>** kind of problem **come =>** so just play with the **0 and 1**
  - take look out on the **count-of-subsequence.js file**

-- **Noted: Keep this Method, keep in Life Time** --
