### Diameter of Tree
- The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. 
- This path may or may not pass through the root of the tree. The length of a path is measured by the number of edges between the nodes along the path.

**For example:**

- In a binary tree with only one node, the diameter is 0 (no edges).
- In a binary tree with multiple nodes, the diameter is determined by the longest path that connects two nodes, which could involve nodes from both the left and right subtrees.

- Hereâ€™s a diagram to help you visualize the diameter of a binary tree. The diameter is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.

**Example Binary Tree:**
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5

Explanation:
The longest path in this tree is: 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3.
The diameter is the number of edges in this path, which is 3.
